<p>"My name is Jason and I am a Web and UX Major. I was once a music major and could tell anyone a similar response to Music(why music....ect). Since this is a dance introductory class I guess I will learn a lot.  My only response to how I dance comes from a singe famous phrase, 

"Life's a dance you learn as you go Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow. Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go." â€• John Michael Montgomery

I sure many have heard of that and I simply dance because its what makes go from really finding the happiness of doing things and getting things done. 

This course seemed interesting to me and I'm taking this course because it fulfils one of my generals. I also like that this course is online and Labs are on Saturday. this allows me to work during the week."</p>

    "Pilobolus "Ok Go and Pilobolus" - My first impression is a dance in the multi-dimension. I noticed greatly that movement was mostly feet, arms, and moving from the side of the body all centered and condensed together. Hiro's video was more opened as it was trying to tell a story. The movement I noticed was also fluent in Pilobolus.  This was used to create a picture that reminded me of geometry dimensions and swimming through space. On the other hand, Hiro's video was more of a walkthrough with sudden angles as I will go more in-depth when talking about his video. 
</p><p>
Hiro Murai "This Is America" - In this video, I noticed that it was about expression. I also notice the message and most expressions came from facial expressions. Not much dancing was done by the entire body compared to Pilobolus. This video had also a pattern of sharp sudden movements followed by a fluent scene. This video I felt like was more like kind of whatever tailored to the message. Where in the other video was structured similarly evenly from the start of the scene.

Los Voladores de Papantla
I thought this dance was would be under number 4. ...Spiritual Connection. At first, you see a flag and 4 men at a top of a pole. I was not sure what they were going to do until they started suspending downward in a spiral going outward. I notice they swung wider and wider and imitation to me made an up arrow toward the sky. That tied with the drums made it seem to me that they were calling the gods/ancestors or whatever the ritually was. 
</p><p>
Another aspect is that it looked scary at first I thought they were tied to one leg and really at that moment I knew it was a ritual. I then look again and I was glad to see they were hooked to a body harness. haha....anyway I would not otherwise see something like this as a dance, but more as a ride if the music and clothes did not play a roll.

I watched the tango and always stop on a station even if its briefly if someone is doing the tango. If I could dance I would tango every week. This tango would fall under courtship. I think some tangos could fall under other types though. 
</p><p>
This tango in particular I noted that it was more on the slow and less snappy side then what I expected. There was more affection in this tango which naturally led me to believe it would fall under courtship."</p>

<p>Swanified! (The Swan/Swan Lake)</p>
<p>"
    I'm familiar with this piece of music, but as far as the dance this is the first. This pretty much means that I've not seen or at payed attention to the dancing of the swan.
</P><p>
 I'm going to break up the swan as the Clips starting with the last.
</p><p>
In this modern form of the swan was the best moment by melody. You didn't really see the base line dance (least to say that the body didn't play a straight rhythm). Instead it moved mostly to the melody and was smother and expressive to a reggae hip-hop type of ballet. I think I can see this peace being an early adopter right when the classic ballet became popular.
(a bias to the others is that only the melody was played with not beat/rhythm to back it up.  (who knows how the back rhythm/melody(sound) could affect the dancer). (Not so much the mixed out of dressed style.))
</p><p>
This ballet seem to merge the beginning and the last clip together. You have beats heavy expression in the legs and the other body parts express the main melody. In my option this was as smooth as the last one I talked about. 
The original really shows it all. At least where this has come from. Considering it was done originally from the ragtime era, the way it was dance kind of makes sense on how it was performed. It was very to the beat and something made for an upbeat entertainment Broadway. This was also faster and of coursed showed strictly more rhythm moment (the lifting of the toes was crazy for me and now I understand better why the music when more to classical side.) and seemed more like a background dancer to the person performing. 
I hope anyone reading this can understand as I kept adding things. Haha=)  *credit swan image: https://pixabay.com/photos/swan-water-white-water-bird-lake-2107052/

I picked Doris Humphrey to represent my choice of modern dance.
</p><p>
First off I really like this because it reminded me of a mutated form of similar dances I have seen. This dance is not really tailored to the by the movement or to the beat or even the melody. It's more of wandering and creating an image around them. I said before this dance reminded me of some of my past, the past of my high school years. I remember all the student body dance in high school that they performed. In a sense, they were doing pretty much the same thing of creating space and making an image through dancing. This type of dance seemed like it was more popular danced in movies of the time.
</p><p>
The main focus of this dance is space, time, and parody from what I can see.</p>

<p>Dancing With The Captins</p>
<p>
    "Paul Nicholas, Dancing With The Captain is a more modern dance and this video was done on the brim of the 80s. You can definitely tell a movement was happening with a transition between the '70s and '80s. Here is obvious an original 70 video where the original show a more upbeat style and clashy 70 style cloths. In this second version is a more rebellious and newer approach accepted modern dancing of the '80s tell now."

"TV - A Great Key - Some thoughts</p><p>

I think tv and dance what really made modern dance today. You are able to reach a way bigger audience and is better than it can be shown then it could ever be written, heard, or being passed down. Because of this, there is no one genre of dance that rules it all.  
</p><p>
Just from the video's shown in the class in this model; tap, jazz, show, single, film, and some others. The movements of the different Ideas of different dance styles have really been easy passed on and practiced since the inventions of the tv. Thriller, of course, is a prime example of this. I mean, I'm sure everyone has seen the video posted on youtube of all inmates at this prison dancing to the thriller stomping, clapping, and singing around.
</p><p>
I think from this we see a lot more singularity in solo artist and expression because such mixed reality is now acceptable because multiple people have come out of the woods on television to take the lead and support the leaders in dance styles and cultures."

Modern Dance
</P><p>
The whole freeze frame and the flash mob were very similar. It really reminded me of much that I have seen on tv and when I went down a few years back to see a similar group at BYU . Both dances show great power of expression and story.The Idea of lunch and the freeze-frame was more about things around them. 
</P><p>
I also liked how to freeze frame used a lot of synced dance movement as the dance went on with the main rapper. This unlike flash move incorporated usual people as undercover dancers that fit into society talking about the common thing of lunch. The movement was first spaced and the came in more and more to wrap around.

    I wanted to look into dance therapy. I have found the video in this module very appealing and here is what I found to become a dance therapist. Quoted from the website below: 
</p><p>
"There are two primary paths to becoming credentialed in dance movement therapy. These include:
</p><p>
Completing an ADTA (American Dance Therapy Association (Links to an external site.)) approved graduate program with the Registered Dance / Movement Therapy (R-DMT) credential.
Completing the alternate route to R-DMT certification through an independent process of training, coursework, fieldwork and internship. The alternative R-DMT option is only available to candidates who have previously completed a graduate program in mental health counseling.
The ADTA only approves graduate programs that fully comply with their credentialing requirements, which includes all of the components required in the alternate certification route. This includes in-depth training in dance-specific therapy methods, fieldwork, and internship.
</p><p>
In addition to the above credentials, dance movement therapists who are going to work with children or adolescents have additional requirements that they must meet. The Board of Directors of the American Dance Therapy Association has set the following guidelines in place for individuals who wish to offer dance and movement therapy to those under 18."
</p><p><a href="https://careersinpsychology.org/dance-movement-therapist-careers/">
https://careersinpsychology.org/dance-movement-therapist-careers/</a> 
</p><p>
It seems like a lot of additional verifications and certifications for this graduate program. After seeing more videos as listed below I can understand why It may take longer or more work to become a graduate. 
</p><p>
The salary ranges that I have found are between 35k and 70k with great benefits because of the medical nature of it.
